It is fascinating the randomness of what gets triggered in the world (and more on social media). Today is the awakening to violence against Black people, yesterday was how crucial health care workers are, a while ago it was Greta Thunberg and climate change.
The way I see it, the hype about all that matters (and should have mattered long time ago) especially from online users who have absolutely zero effect on what's going on, zero knowledge and zero interest other than riding the wave (since everyone is), this hype correlates perfectly with the degree of boredom. Do you think that in times other than these where people didn't face a pandemic and a strict confinement and a human need for attention that the incident of George Floyd would alert to injustice facing people of color everyday?

Absolutely not. So enough with your hashtags and useless support. Either show your awakening ALL the time and to EVERY injustice, or keep your hypocrisy to yourself.
