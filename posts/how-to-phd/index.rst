This is definitely not an easy post to write. Here I am writing it a year after my defense and six months into my postdoc stage. Jumping into a PhD does not come with a manual, and I've learnt (the hard way) that there is no ONE way to do it, it is an art rather than a well defined procedure. However, there are usually a few relevant questions you should be considering before starting a PhD:

* Do some history reseach: What was/is expected in Academia from a PhD student and what was the origin idea of getting a doctorate?

* Why do you want to get a PhD degree?

* What can a PhD degree do for you for your future career (I think the answer to this question becomes clearer in the late stages of your PhD)

This post is just an introduction to those who just found this blog and want (or already) to pursue a career in Academia. There will be more elaborate posts on handeling the different parts of a PhD/postdoc research and of an academic life in general. I should note here that this is my personal experience and you might or might not find it useful to follow the same mentality and/or practice. But there are always shared experiences and shared way of handeling them.
