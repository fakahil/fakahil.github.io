**Warning: There will be a lot of bitching about white people, so don't get offended ;) It is not a personal attack, it is a critique on a collective  behavior.**

I have been living in Germany since 2015. I have taken part in all sorts of communities in my search for "self-identity". When you live abroad to study, you are often hit with the question of what defines you. You want to know everything about the world. The world and its 7 billion population were nothing to me but a news on TV or an information in my textbook. When I first arrived, I was driven by the challenge of opening my eyes to new worlds. I am not going to blog all of my life abroad experience here (I will be though, gradually), but in this post I want to focus on one astonishing thing: the polished racism.

"People here are nice" that's the first thing I've noticed in Europe and told my family. At first I thought well they are just nice, that's great, my life here is going to be easy. It is only later that I realized no one is nice for no reason. 
See for white people, coming from a non-white culture is exotic. They like everything that is different, out of demeaning curiosity. 
I have noticed how in conversations they are noticeably careful when speaking to someone with a non-white background (Indian, Arab, Latin, Persian, Hijabi women..). They always give them extra attention, smiling excessively at them. Some of them (especially women) end up dating them and not out of love, but just to have this exotic experience and brag about it to their white friends, or out of unexplainable white guilt combined with a naive perspective on diversity in love or in love itself. 

Another thing that dazzled me is adopting black children, especially among people from the leftist community. They think that somehow doing so contributes to ending racism. I don't know how to rationalize this, but at first sight this made me wanna throw my gut out. 
 
Now let's talk about traveling. Every German student I've met here was either saving money or working towards leaving school to travel. Travel is on everyone's to do list here. Some international students started imitating them as well, including me. And guess where would white folks like to go? yes you got it! to some poor ass third world country.

Going on a trip to India or Thailand to find oneself is nothing but ridiculous. So what? they get bored with the first world luxuries and want to witness other people's sufferings so they could feel better about themselves and finally appreciate their privilege? I have seen a repetitive pattern of going to the poorest regions in the world and taking pictures of kids playing in a swamp or for women in traditional clothing standing on the door and staring at the horizon. What the hell is this for? so when they get back home they gather with their friends over dinner and wine and brag about all the self healing experiences they've encountered? (facepalm).

They think they know how to handle life and its hardships, they think they could master the art of surviving by simply following a vegan diet and attending yoga classes. You see their book stores full of books on how to live life peacefully and survive in this loud world, on how to be successful, intellectual, charismatic, influential, productive.... I don't know about that but trying to have control over everything and maintaining this perfect picture of how to live to the fullest is maybe the reason why those books exist in the first place. Don't get me wrong, I admire the power of this country, the discipline of its individuals. I am actually working towards being a German citizen for the benefits this country provides on all scales. But my energy is drained, I am exhausted all the time. Everyday is another day to prove myself, to work hard and be the best I could, because those who want to stay, they have to earn it. It is also life in Academia that has an extra effect as well. And even after I become a citizen, I will be stuck in this productive lifestyle and who knows, maybe one day I would like to travel to India to find myself again.
