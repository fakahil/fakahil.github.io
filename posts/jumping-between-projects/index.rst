Personally, everything in life is fine if my work is going on track, meaning if I am getting the wanted result from my current task. That is why when things don't go the way I expect in one project, I get busy with another mental task.

Our minds need constant change, I cannot be focused on one task for more than two weeks. That is the reason I am writing this blog actually. This is how I like to distract myself from work: learning a programing language, some new computing skill, helping others with their data analysis tasks or explaining some scientific topic to them. For me, the thrill of learning something new and applying it myself is a major help to proceed with stuck ideas in my mind. 

I used to feel guilty whenever I am performing a non-work related task, but hey, everything you do and learn will eventually help you with your professional project, if not, it will get your mind off your task, refresh it so you could get back with a new perspective. It is good sometimes to take some distance (not only in human relationships;)
