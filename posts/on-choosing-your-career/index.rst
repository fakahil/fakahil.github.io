The Pandemic is hard on all acadmemics, especially the international PhD's, postdocs or scientists who are abroad and away from their families. Loneliness can have a toll on this category of academics because aside from the uncertainty about their career future, there is the struggle of making it through the day without seeing loved ones, colleagues and friends. Some of us thrive poorly without the usual work environment: motivated by even the sight of people working, coffee breaks and discussing the work with superiors and colleagues. Remote work is not for academics because interaction is an essential ingredient for academic growth. And without this important factor, we see no meaning of sepnding days and weeks working on a set of data.
