I finished binge watching Breaking Bad some time now, had a lot of thoughts about it, but now that I'm spending some quality time with my head, I need to put it out there.
It's a great picture, no doubt. Technically speaking, the way it was shot, the sceneries, the scenario, everything was simple yet elegant. I had a friend who I used to share my office with, there was a time when he was so excited about finishing work and heading to another friend's place to cook pasta and watch Breaking Bad. I never doubted his style in picture, or in anything, but considering that everyone else was watching it and it was a hit among scholars for reasons I will show later, I thought not to follow the crowd, like I always don't.

Two years after he passed away, I was browsing Netflix and Breaking Bad was among the suggestions, I made myself a cup of tea and thought well, Cheers Ale.

I don't want to focus here on how sexist BB is, I only want to focus on the reasons it is a great hit among Men more than women. I think the reasons are nakedly obvious, hopefully. BB is simply a fantasy for all those Academic nerds coming true. Who would not like to use their scientific knowledge to build a drug kingdom and earn millions of dollars to help their loved ones live a decent life? Be it going to a good college, buy a fancy car, own a small (or big) business and just live happily ever after (yes money brings happiness, or at least it buys you the things that make you happy).

But is it only for these reasons most of BB's fans are Men? Nope. Unless you live under a rock and are unfamiliar with the gender roles men play in Society, BB portrayed perfectly the principle of "Toxic Masculinity". Walter was the bullied by the people and the system small man, and only shitty life circumstances allowed him to unleash the true self he has always been, a man with toxic pride. Along the series you see perfectly how his personality develops into this fearless leader who is perfectly able to bury all the emotions that might destroy his march towards Glory. Who would say no to Glory?

What is even dazzling me (or maybe not), is how Heisenberg is popular among the young generation of the left scene, you see his face used frequently in any political demonstration, as a symbol for rebellion. Seriously? rebellion against what? this man has brought nothing but hell to his family, he was so self centered ("I did it for me and I liked it") that he destroyed any hope for his loved ones to carry on normally with their lives. So maybe I should not be surprised when BB male fans ignore those aspects of his personality and focus on the badass ones, because as I said, it's all about fantasy fulfillment in a male dominant world.

I need not to say more about the topic, everything is perfectly described in `The Toxic Masculinity in Breaking Bad <https://www.wired.com/2013/10/breaking-bad-toxic-masculinity/>`_ . I was glad to see other women sharing the same thoughts.
