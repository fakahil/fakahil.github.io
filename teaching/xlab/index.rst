Every year the `XLAB <http://xlab-goettingen.de/xlab_international.html>`_ hosts a science camp for distinguished high school students from all around the world. I have taken part in organizing the Astromomy camp week.

I have presented an introductory lecture on Solar Physics and basics of how to use Spectroscopy to infer properties of stars and their atmospheres. 

In addition, I have also organized a couple of laboratory sessions for experiments on Spectroscopy. After that, the students were given the opportunity to work on reduced Sunrise data and make a small statistical study on the properties of solar granulation and bright points.
