I have supervised a distinguished high school student in the summer semester of 2017 for three weeks.
During her visit to the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, she worked on reduced and inverted IMAX/sunrise data. She had the chance to learn about Solar Physics and data analysis.

In addition, she has learned the basics of programming with Python.
