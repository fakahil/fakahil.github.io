Nostalgia is the act of missing a place we are currently not occupying or a situation which occured in the past. We often have this feeling when we are clueless about the present. It is easy to understand the mechanism: when we get trapped in time where do we go? the present is ugly, the future has not happened yet, and it's hard to predict even when we have enough data to extrapolate, our minds have not lived the future. So we go back, to the past. The past is the safe haven of the troubled mind, even if the past was painful, as soon as our mind gets hold of one memory of joy, it tricks us to believe that the whole era was beautiful. We often hear and say the expression "These were the good times" when we bring up a shared happy memory, but does one such memory imply the goodness of the past days? Didn't you in that memory broke in to a party with your friend, had a lot of booze, danced till dawn then got back home and woke up with a terrible acid reflux and bucket next to your bed? Didn't you spend the whole weekend recovering mentally and physically from that night? didn't you get back to work on Monday with a foggy brain and had a lot of stress to finish that damned paper? THE PAST TIMES WERE NOT BEAUTIFUL yet we tend to miss them. What is interesting is how old pictures of a city we have never visited triggers nostalgia.
