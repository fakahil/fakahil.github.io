<p>One of the mental behaviors I started developing abroad is the consistent need to compare between here and there, even if I don't want to, it became so automatic that I could no longer enjoy the sight of something my home country lacks.
It later became associated with feelings of envy and anger, and of looking down on white people who are benefiting from their systems, but also on those who are rebelling against it. I could not understand what I really want from such comparison and subsequent feelings of resilience. I saw an enemy in everyone and a competition in everything, an enemy to what exactly and a competition with whom? I had (and still have) no idea.</p>
<p>What I could understand are the feelings of jealousy upon the sight of a group of teenage boys walking on the streets looking so cool with their headphones and skateboards and ridiculously stylish haircuts. I thought about how they could safely take buses, hang out at night in some park, get back home to a prepared supper, and having to bear their parents ANNOYING questions about their girlfriends (or boyfriends, because you know, support). They go to sleep peacefully to start a brand new day in their schools with a blind trust in their educational system taking care of their every step towards a fulfilled professional life and career.</p>
<p>I am jealous of the old people in their eighties who wake up at 7 am and start their days in a cafe, enjoying what is left of their lives which are taken care of by the system they had long served.</p>
<p>I am jealous of the Mom who can have as much babies as she wants because she does not have to worry about her career.</p>
<p>I am jealous of the sick people in the waiting area of the hospital who can gracefully enjoy a TV show on dogs because they trust their health system, and no matter what the doctor says they have, they will receive the best treatment there is.</p>
<p>I am jealous of the trees, the parks, the neat streets, the couple waiting for the traffic lights to turn green. I am jealous of the houses, I still can't comprehend how they appear as someone has built them out of a bag of Legos! Sometimes it's hard for me to grasp the beautiful coordination between the streets and everything green around it. I try to add some distortion for my brain to take it in, but nope, my brain is not tuned to that frequency.</p>
<p>Five years I spent here and I can't get used to how everything is in place.
On some days I have the urge to watch a documentary on the wars in the middle east, or any footage of war and misery and poverty.
I sometimes scare myself when I turn into an addict who is begging for a shot of chaos, and if I am out of options, I turn my room into a zone of Entropy, not showering for days and leaving all my dirty dishes in the sink. Yes that's an addiction you might have never heard of, but it exists. You will only see it (or not) in those who thought they'd find peace and freedom away from the cursed parts of this Earth where they were born.</p>
<p>But, Freedom here is tasteless. To tell you the truth, I have never enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Here, you are given the freedom to do whatever you like without any judgment or fear, to love whoever you want, to walk safe at night, to choose your future career with the same degree of trouble as picking out a movie to watch. But you are also given the freedom to die at any time with no one giving a shit about you.</p>
<p>I am a sick person, so I spend the majority of my time in clinics and hospitals. In my attempt to improve my German (and understand Earthlings), I always monitor how people behave and talk. One thing I've noticed is how robotic the communication is between patients and medical staff. It's in their eyes and words that you could sense it's just a business like any other. If you are dying from pain, you will have to go through the standard procedure, show your health insurance card, fill out some forms (even if you can't move a muscle in your body and about to faint), and setting up an appointment if you don't have one.. It happened to me personally that I sometimes thought about faking fainting for them to see how urgent my case was and treat me right away, without an appointment (oh! the dream).</p>
<p>Five years I spent here and I have never seen a funeral, or any form of weeping on the deceased, or anyone crying for any fucking reason! The city looks like it was taken over by humanly dressed robots and feelings are hiding like exiled useless entities.</p>
<p>All I could see here is dystopia, and all I have from there is nostalgia and I'm stuck in between.</p>
