I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at `Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research <https://www.mps.mpg.de>`_. 

My research focuses on calibrating and analysing solar data delivered by remote-sensing instrumentation.

As a postdoc, I am a member of the `PHI/solo calibration team <https://www.mps.mpg.de/sonnenforschung/solar-orbiter-phi>`_. I am carrying out detailed analyses of specific instrumental properties of the PHI instrument and writing calibration procedures to correct for the geometrical distortion, point spread function and straylight.

As a doctoral student, I worked on `Sunrise data <https://www.mps.mpg.de/solar-physics/sunrise>`_. I used radiative transfer modeling to invert spectropolarimetric data and derive the magnetic field maps and other useful physical quantities. The aim of my thesis project was to investigate the relationship between the magnetic field and brightness contrast of small-scale magnetic elements in the quiet Sun and active region plages. I also worked on characterising the stray light properties of the sunrise telescope.

I divide my PhD project into mini projects which I blog about in `Sunrise <https://fatima.kahil.github.io/sunrise/>`_ . 

All the calibration procedures which I have written for the PHI instrument are found in the `Solar Orbiter <https://fatima.kahil.github.io/solo/>`_ page. This includes the following topics:


Functions and procedures written in Python that are useful for scientific research and general data science can be found `here <https://fatima.kahil.github.io/science/>`_ 

My procedures and work on MURAM simulations can be found in `MURAM simulations <https://fatima.kahil.github.io/muram/>`_.
